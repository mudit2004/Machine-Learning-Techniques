# Logistic Regression

This repository contains implementations and analysis of logistic regression applied to three different datasets: Breast Cancer, Student Result, and Heart Disease. 

## Datasets

1. **Breast Cancer Dataset (from sklearn)**:
   - This dataset is available in the scikit-learn library and contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The task is to classify whether the tumor is malignant or benign based on these features.

2. **Student Result Dataset**:
   - This dataset contains information about students' performance in various subjects and demographic details. The objective is to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on their attributes.

3. **Heart Disease Dataset (from Kaggle)**:
   - This dataset contains various features related to heart health and aims to predict whether a patient has heart disease. It is sourced from Kaggle and provides a valuable real-world application of logistic regression.

## Implementation

The logistic regression algorithm has been implemented using Python, primarily utilizing the scikit-learn library. The implementation includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and performance analysis.
