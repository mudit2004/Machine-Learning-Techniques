# Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) for Multi-Class Classification

This repository demonstrates the use of Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) for multi-class classification tasks, comparing its performance with Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## Introduction

Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) is a probabilistic model used for regression and classification tasks. It offers advantages over Support Vector Machine (SVM) in terms of sparsity and uncertainty estimation.

In this project, we use RVM and SVM for a multi-class classification task using the famous Iris dataset.
