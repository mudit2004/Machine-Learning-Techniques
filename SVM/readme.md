# Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Overview
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful type of supervised learning algorithm used in machine learning for classification and regression tasks. SVMs excel particularly in solving binary classification problems by identifying the best possible line, or decision boundary, that separates data points of different classes.

## How SVMs Work
SVMs work by transforming input data into a higher-dimensional feature space using kernel functions. This transformation simplifies finding linear separations or effective classification. SVMs can handle both linearly separable and non-linearly separable data through various kernel functions like linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF).

## Types of SVMs
There are two main types of SVMs:
- **Linear SVM:** Utilizes a linear kernel to create a straight-line decision boundary.
- **Nonlinear SVM:** Addresses scenarios where data cannot be separated by a straight line and uses kernel functions to find linear decision boundaries in higher-dimensional feature spaces.

## Advantages of SVMs
- Effective in high-dimensional spaces.
- Resistant to overfitting.
- Versatile for both classification and regression tasks.
- Suitable for limited data scenarios.
- Capable of handling nonlinear data through kernel tricks.

## Disadvantages of SVMs
- Computationally intensive, especially with large datasets.
- Sensitive to parameter tuning.
- Lack probabilistic outputs directly.
- Difficulty in interpreting complex models.
- May face scalability issues with extremely large datasets.

## Important Vocabulary
- **C parameter:** Controls the tradeoff between maximizing the margin and minimizing misclassification.
- **Decision boundary:** Imaginary line separating different groups or categories in a dataset.
- **Kernel function:** Mathematical function used to compute the inner product between data points in transformed feature spaces.
- **Margin:** Distance between the decision boundary and the support vectors.
- **Regularization:** Technique used to prevent overfitting in SVMs.
