# **What is KNN?**
  • The k-nearest neighbors algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN, is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.
  • While it can be used for either regression or classification problems, it is typically used as a classification algorithm,
  • The K-NN algorithm compares a new data entry to the values in a given data set (with different classes or categories). 
  • Based on its closeness or similarities in a given range (K) of neighbors, the algorithm assigns the new data to a class or category in the data set (training data).

# **Parametric Vs Non-Parametric**
  • Parametric algorithms are best suited for problems where the input data is well-defined and predictable.
  • A parametric model can predict future values using only the parameters.

  • Nonparametric algorithms are best suited for problems where the input data is not well-defined but there are a lot more data we can use to train it.
  • While nonparametric machine learning algorithms are often slower and require large amounts of data, they are rather flexible as they minimize the assumptions they make about the data.
