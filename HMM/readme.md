# Viterbi Algorithm

## Overview

The Viterbi Algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm used for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states—called the Viterbi path—that results in a sequence of observed events. It has applications in various fields such as speech recognition, natural language processing, bioinformatics, and more.

## Advantages

- **Efficiency**: The Viterbi Algorithm efficiently computes the most likely sequence of states given a sequence of observations, especially in cases where brute force search methods would be computationally prohibitive.
- **Optimality**: It guarantees the optimality of the computed path under certain conditions, ensuring that the most probable state sequence is found.
- **Versatility**: The algorithm is applicable to a wide range of problems in different domains, making it a versatile tool for various tasks involving hidden Markov models (HMMs).

## Disadvantages

- **Assumption of Markov Property**: The algorithm relies on the Markov property, assuming that the future state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of previous states. This assumption may not hold in some real-world scenarios.
- **Sensitivity to Model Parameters**: Performance of the Viterbi Algorithm can be sensitive to the accuracy of the transition probabilities and emission probabilities specified in the underlying HMM. Small errors in these parameters can lead to significant deviations in the computed path.
- **Complexity in Training**: Training a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to estimate the model parameters (transition probabilities and emission probabilities) can be complex, especially for large datasets with high-dimensional observation spaces.
