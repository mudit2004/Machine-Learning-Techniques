# Multi-layer Feed Forward Network Program on MNIST (Image) Dataset

## Description
This repository contains a Python program for implementing a multi-layer feed forward neural network on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) along with their corresponding labels. The neural network is implemented using the Keras library, which provides an easy-to-use interface for building and training deep learning models.

## Features
- Loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset.
- Displaying sample images from the training dataset.
- Implementing a multi-layer feed forward neural network using Keras.
- Training and evaluating the neural network.
- Trying different configurations (number of layers, neurons per layer, activation functions).
- Generating and displaying a classification report.
- Plotting a confusion matrix to visualize the network's performance.
