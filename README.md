## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of machine learning algorithms and techniques that I've implemented as part of my coursework during my third year in college. The implementations are coded in Python using libraries such as NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

## Algorithms Implemented

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- K-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Llinear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

## Usage

To use any of the implemented algorithms, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/machine-learning-techniques.git
