## Introduction to CNNs

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized kind of neural network for processing data that has a grid-like topology. They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems, image classification, medical image analysis, and natural language processing.

## How CNNs Work

CNNs consist of multiple layers of neurons that have learnable weights and biases. Each neuron in a layer is connected to only a small region of the layer before it, instead of being fully connected. This is inspired by the organization of the animal visual cortex.

## Applications of CNNs

- Image Classification
- Object Detection
- Facial Recognition
- Medical Image Analysis
- Natural Language Processing

## Getting Started
